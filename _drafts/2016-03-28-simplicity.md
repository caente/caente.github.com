One of the first things you hear when you become just a notch serious about programming, is that simplicity is important. Then you learn that is paramount. What you might never learn (never as in the first 3-5 years), is what simplicity means. You think you know, but you will often confuse “simple” with “easy” or even with a false sense of pragmatism.

Most people who start coding will try to "simplify" the code (i.e. by artificially keeping methods and functions small). But _simplicity_ is actually about the concepts handled in your code.

Any programming task could be seen as either an attempt of creating a _formal system_ for your problem, or once in it, find the _proofs_ for its _theorems_. Which should take you to "build" the solution, rather than "find" it.

Unfortunately, it’s easier and “faster” to just take whatever input and squeeze the solution out of it. The code then will not represent the solution to the problem, instead it’ll be some kind of “mechanical accident” that happens to produce the solution you are looking for.

Other coders (including your future self) will be unable to understand the code by knowing the problem, nor will they understand the solution by looking at the code. This will cause infinite headaches in the near future and will threaten the project health in the distant future.

There could be a couple of ways to speed up the understanding of simplicity: Read and study as much as you can about the fundamentals of computer science and programming. Also it’s very important to have the feedback of other developers. You need to understand, as soon as possible, that your code is not only meant to make computers calculate stuff. It’s a means of communicating ideas and inventions. It might not look like it in most of the entry level coding jobs. But as soon you are in a team, you will be “communicating ideas and inventions” about whatever domain your company happens to belong to.
